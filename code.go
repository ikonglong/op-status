	// may be converted to this error.

	// CodeInvalidArgument means that the client specified an invalid argument.

	// CodeDeadlineExceeded means the deadline expired before the operation could complete.
	// For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be returned

	// response from a server could have been delayed long enough for the deadline
	// to expire.

	// CodeNotFound means that some requested entity (e.g., file or directory) was not found.
	//
	// Note to server developers: if a request is denied for an entire class
	// of users, such as gradual feature rollout or undocumented allowlist,
	// `CodeNotFound` may be used. If a request is denied for some users within
	// a class of users, such as user-based access control, `CodePermissionDenied`
	// must be used.

	CodeAlreadyExists = newCode("AlreadyExists", 6)

	// CodePermissionDenied The caller does not have permission to execute the specified
	// operation. `CodePermissionDenied` must not be used for rejections caused by
	// exhausting some resource (use `CodeResourceExhausted` instead for those errors).
	// `CodePermissionDenied` must not be used if the caller can not be identified
	// (use `CodeUnauthenticated` instead for those errors). This error code does not
	// imply the request is valid or the requested entity exists or satisfies
	// other pre-conditions.
	//
	// HTTP Mapping: 403 Forbidden
	CodePermissionDenied = newCode("PermissionDenied", 7)

	// CodeUnauthenticated means that the request does not have valid authentication
	// credentials for the operation.

	// HTTP Mapping: 401 Unauthorized
	CodeUnauthenticated = newCode("Unauthenticated", 16)

	// CodeResourceExhausted means that some resource has been exhausted, perhaps
	// a per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space.

	// HTTP Mapping: 429 Too Many Requests
	CodeResourceExhausted = newCode("ResourceExhausted", 8)

	// CodeFailedPrecondition means that the operation was rejected because the system
	// is not in a state required for the operation's execution.  For example,
	// the directory to be deleted is non-empty, a rmdir operation is applied to
	// a non-directory, etc.
	//
	// Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide
	// between `CodeFailedPrecondition`, `CodeAborted`, and `CodeUnavailable`:
	//  (a) Use `CodeUnavailable` if the client can retry just the failing call.
	//  (b) Use `CodeAborted` if the client should retry at a higher level. For
	//      example, when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the
	//      client should restart a read-modify-write sequence.
	//  (c) Use `CodeFailedPrecondition` if the client should not retry until
	//      the system state has been explicitly fixed. For example, if a "rmdir"
	//      fails because the directory is non-empty, `CodeFailedPrecondition`
	//      should be returned since the client should not retry unless
	//      the files are deleted from the directory.
	//
	// HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request
	CodeFailedPrecondition = newCode("FailedPrecondition", 9)

	// CodeAborted means that the operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency
	// issue such as a sequencer check failure or transaction abort.
	//
	// See the guidelines above for deciding between `CodeFailedPrecondition`,
	// `CodeAborted`, and `CodeUnavailable`.
	//
	// HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
	CodeAborted = newCode("OperationAborted", 10)

	// CodeOutOfRange means that the operation was attempted past the valid range.
	// E.g., seeking or reading past end-of-file.
	//
	// Unlike `CodeInvalidArgument`, this error indicates a problem that may
	// be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file
	// system will generate `CodeInvalidArgument` if asked to read at an
	// offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate
	// `CodeOutOfRange` if asked to read from an offset past the current
	// file size.
	//
	// There is a fair bit of overlap between `CodeFailedPrecondition` and
	// `CodeOutOfRange`.  We recommend using `CodeOutOfRange` (the more specific
	// error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through
	// a space can easily look for an `CodeOutOfRange` error to detect when
	// they are done.
	//
	// HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request
	CodeOutOfRange = newCode("OutOfRange", 11)

	// supported/enabled in this service.

	// CodeInternal errors. This means that some invariants expected by the
	// underlying system have been broken. This error code is reserved
	// for serious errors.

	CodeInternal = newCode("InternalError", 13)

	// CodeUnavailable means that the service is currently unavailable. This is
	// most likely a transient condition, which can be corrected by retrying
	// with a backoff. Note that it is not always safe to retry
	// non-idempotent operations.
	//
	// See the guidelines above for deciding between `CodeFailedPrecondition`,
